title: About me
---

My name is Granville Matheson.  I'm currently a PhD student at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden working with positron emission tomography (PET).  I'm interested in brains, behaviour, modelling and stats, and R is my happy place.  I'm the author of the [kinfitr](https://github.com/mathesong/kinfitr), for PET kinetic modelling in R.

This is my personal page for data science side projects, or main projects or for whatever else ends up here.

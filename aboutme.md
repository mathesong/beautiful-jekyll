subtitle: Who I am and what I do

I'm a PhD student at Karolinska Institutet working with clinical neuroscience.  I'm big on brains, behaviour, modelling thereof, stats, and R is my happy place.  I'm the author of the [kinfitr](https://github.com/mathesong/kinfitr) package for performing PET kinetic modelling in R.

The aim of this page is as a place to put fun data science analyses, side projects, main projects and whatever else ends up here.
